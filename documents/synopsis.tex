\section*{Synopsis til Bachelor projekt 2010}
\subsection*{Title}
Procedural content creation for benchmarking physics simulation.
\subsection*{Problem Formulation}
Is it possible to extend the existing prototype for benchmarking physics engines, to include procedural content
creation.
Is it possible to create viable data structures to contain 3D objects for use in dynamics simulations, including relevant physical attributes. The aim of the
project is is to develop a way to create objects inside the prototype using procedural modelling without the use of external tool.

\subsection*{Topic delimitations}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The project will be limited to simple structures like cubes and spheres. 
	\item It will only be possible to create and place objects by inputting parameters and not by dragging and
	dropping.
	\item The objects will be presumed to be made of a homogeneous material to easier calculate center of gravity
	\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Motivation}
The problem to be solved by this prototype, It can be cumbersome to test physics engines when time has to be wasted
setting up test scenarios in standard tools. If its possible to use procedural modelling to make test data it will
improve the workflow for benchmarking physic engines. It will make it easier to set up different test environments. 

With procedural content creation it is possible to create completely different test cases with only a few minor changes
to the input. With procedural content creation it is easy to create large test scenarios that will test the limits of the
physics engine. 

With further development these data structures will possibly be able to make it easier to create more complex scenarios
and a better benchmarking tool. These complex scenarios will contribute to a more exhaustive and complete test.
\subsection*{Evaluation}
To complete our goal we will need to write a data structure that can hold relevant attributes for a 3D object and can be
created procedurally. We need to design a way with which the object can be created within the benchmarking tool.
