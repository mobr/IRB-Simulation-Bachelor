\section*{Synopsis til Bachelor projekt 2010}
\subsection*{Title}
Procedural content creation for benchmarking physics simulation.
\subsection*{Problem Formulation}
Is it possible to extend the existing prototype for benchmarking physics engines, to include procedural content
creation.
Is it possible to create viable data structures to contain 3D objects for use in dynamics simulations, including relevant physical attributes. The aim of the
project is is to develop a way to create objects inside the prototype using procedural modelling without the use of external tool.

\subsection*{Topic delimitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The project will be limited to primitives e.g. cubes and spheres and there combinations. 
	\item It will only be possible to create and place objects by inputting parameters and not by dragging and
	dropping.
	\item The objects will be presumed to be made of a homogeneous material to easier calculate center of gravity
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Motivation}
It can be cumbersome to test physics engines when time has to be wasted
setting up test scenarios in standard tools. If its possible to use procedural modelling to make test data it will
improve the workflow for benchmarking physic engines. It will make it easier to set up different test environments and recycle the scenarios with
different configurations. 

These scenarios will be made out of primitives and combinations of primitives, so an obvious criteria for the project is to make it 
easy to setup and change large sets of primitives.
With procedural content creation it is possible to create completely different test cases with only a few minor changes
to the input. With procedural content creation it is easy to create large test scenarios that will test the limits of the
physics engine. 

With further development these data structures will possibly be able to make it easier to create more complex scenarios
and a better benchmarking tool. These complex scenarios will contribute to a more exhaustive and complete test.
\subsection*{Learning objectives}
\begin{description}
\item[The prototype] 	Familiarize ourself with: \emph{cmake}, \emph{Ogre3D}, \emph{Bullet}. 
			We need to be able to run, test and describe the existing prototype.
\item[Interview] Conduct an interview with a possible end user, to clarify how the current workflow of benchmarking is performed.
		 This should lay a foundation to produce the physical and visual attributes needed for this project. 
\item[Physics attributes]Be able to identify and describe physical attributes relevant to our project. The end goal is to spot possible difficulties in the
			area of physics simulation with rigid bodies.
\item[Complex tests] Be able to set up more complex test scenarios easier with procedural content creation e.g. modelling a Eiffel tower and a
			greek temple.
\item[Evaluate.] Evaluate the effects on the workflow of benchmarking(HCI?) physics simulations.
\item[Validate.] Verify the physical correctness in the simulations, produced by using our project. 
		This could be done by making predictable test cases and evaluate if the react in the expected way. 
\item[Showcase] Show the capabilities of the system e.g. with a video of more complex simulations.

\subsection*{Project schedule}
\begin{description}
\item[Friday 24. September: Hand in of synopsis.]
\item[Week 39 to 41: Research of physics and 3D engine.] We need to do some general research in order to get a better
							understanding for the subject of physics simulation. 
							Among other things we need to find out what information is relevant to keep in the
							data structure. 

\item[Week 39 to 42: Code digging in existing prototype.]Investigate the internal workings of the existing prototype, to familiarise ourself 
							with it and be able to identify and describe 
							the parts that are relevant to our project. And why they are relevant.
							An important part of this objective is to get the prototype up and running, 
							and run the existing test scenarios.
\item[Week 42: Related programming skills] This week overlaps both the previous and the next schedule point and is about acquiring needed 
					   programming skills for doing the project. This includes but is not necessarily limited by C++ 
					   templates and general C++ skills. There will not be and explanation of these subjects in the 
					   final report, but we need to allocate some time for studying this.

\item[Week 42 to 45: Analysis of problem and its solution.] Analysis of different possible solutions and there pros and cons. Using information
							    gained at the earlier stages, we need to make and document an informed choice 
							    about the design of the solution.

\item[Week 45 to 51: Extending prototype with procedural content creation.] 	This is where we implement our solution into
										the existing prototype.

\item[Week 48 to 1: Writing report.]
							This is the final part of writing the report. 
							We will be writing during the entire process but in these weeks we will be
							focusing more on the report

\item[Week 1 to 2:  Proofreading.]			By this time we should be done with the report and be 
							making the final changes and the last proofreading.
\item[Tuesday 11. January: Hand in of report.]
\item[Wednesday 12. January to 27. January: Preparation for defence.]
\item[27-28 January: Defence of project.]
